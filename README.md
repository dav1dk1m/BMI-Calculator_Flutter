### Features:
1. Responsive UI: Adapts gracefully across different screen sizes and orientations.
2. Intuitive Inputs: Dropdown selection for height (feet and inches) and a text field for weight.
3. Instant Feedback: Provides error messages for incomplete inputs and classifications like Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, and Severely Overweight based on BMI results.
